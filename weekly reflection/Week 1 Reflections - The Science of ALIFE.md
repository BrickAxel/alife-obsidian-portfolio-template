*Note: This would be in reference the Tuesday of Week 2's class* 
What did you learn from the other student presentations on the Week 1 topic?
I learned that we all have different goals in this class but by learning about what the others are doing we can get different incite into our own goals.

How does it connect to what you learned from your own work?
The big thing that stuck with me is the amount of unseen cherry picking that could be going on behind the scenes in my areas of interest, like how the art was selected for us.

What would you like to learn more about?
Honestly I still want to go full tilt at chemistry/physics.


## Time Management Plan
How do you plan to manage your time with the expectation of spending  ~3.5 or more hours of time outside of class between Thursday and Tuesday class sessions?
